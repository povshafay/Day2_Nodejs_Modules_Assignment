What are modules in Node.js?
Modules are reusable pieces of code that can be exported and imported between files using require() and module.exports.

Difference between core modules and custom modules:
- Core modules are built-in, like fs, http, path.
- Custom modules are user-defined JavaScript files that export functions or objects.
